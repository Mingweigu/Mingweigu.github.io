      <description>“Yes, you’re dead. Welcome to Central Processing. Please wait for your number to be called”
I woke up and saw the large, butcher paper banner.
It was hand-written in heavy, black marker. Except for the message, it wouldn’t have been out of place at my granddaughter’s high school pep rallies.
In my right hand, I had a paper slip with the numbers “A0F35B1 - Francine”
I was sitting in a grey, plastic folding chair.</description>

      <description>The lemon merengue pie sailed through the air and splattered on his face.
Lenny sat motionless on stage in the school auditorium. One camera clicked and flashed. He leaned forward slowly and gently removed the pie tin, catching the largest pie chunks. Another camera. He placed the tin on the table besides him and grabbed a few paper towels.

      <description>All he cared about was his dignity. Even at the cost of his soul.
Jim’s daughters had said that about him many years ago. It had hurt to hear, but he had nothing to say in return.

      <description>The following is a story snippet based on a prompt from this MasterClass article.
