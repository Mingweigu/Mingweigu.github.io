				<p>For far too long, I&rsquo;ve had trouble getting through creative work without interruption. Specifically, in the middle of work I&rsquo;m doing, I&rsquo;d think about the appropriate level of quality. About whether it&rsquo;ll be successful. About what it means for my identity. And to my future.</p>
<p>My mind goes wandering. And I want to do anything but do the actual task at hand. I&rsquo;d go on social media or check my email. And there goes the next half hour.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why whenever I do get to do the task without thinking of those questions, I feel free and get to revel in getting the thing done.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m going for is flow. What I&rsquo;d love is, at the heart of it, flow states throughout the day and the week.</p>
<p>I do want my work to be of good quality and to be &ldquo;successful&rdquo; (however that&rsquo;s defined) and to connect with my identity and future. But thinking of all that while doing the work is self-defeating.</p>
<p>Here are the questions that keep coming up for me.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-any-good">Is This Any Good?</h2>
<p>Especially for a new skill, where I don&rsquo;t have a good sense of what is high <strong>quality</strong>, I&rsquo;ll be asking myself this question all the time.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s writing. But when I first started programming or managing, I was asking myself this all the time. And a lot of times, the asking of this question while actually doing the tasks gets in the way of doing the tasks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll have to do with, will other people appreciate what I&rsquo;m doing? Will they engage with it?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to revisit the quality of your work on a periodic basis, and to come up with concrete steps for improvement. For example, while editing or reviewing code. But to constantly be asking this while doing the task is unproductive.</p>
<h2 id="will-it-be-successful">Will it be successful?</h2>
<p>This is regarding the <strong>results</strong> of what I produce. Wells Baum wrote on his blog to be <a href="https://wellsbaum.blog/impatient-with-action-patient-with-results/">&ldquo;impatient with action, patient with results&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>In a flow state, you have to be indifferent. Just getting the work out from your mind is more important. You can always adjust later on and iterate.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it-for">What is it for?</h2>
<p>If I&rsquo;m the one assigning myself a task, it means I haven&rsquo;t done a good job of explaining what the task is and why it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But this is a job for before the task is started. So the thing to do is before I start something, I&rsquo;ll write out what I&rsquo;m doing and briefly why it&rsquo;s important. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll be enough to power me through the task without asking this question.</p>
<p>If it comes up during a task, I&rsquo;ll convince myself the task is for itself.</p>
<p>Now, this presupposes tasks are small enough. So I&rsquo;d say if it keeps coming up after a day or two, then to revisit whether the task makes sense for what I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish.</p>
<h2 id="am-i-meant-to-be-a-_______-am-i-a-real-____">Am I meant to be a _______? Am I a real ____?</h2>
<p>I grapple with this a ton. It&rsquo;s related to the question of &ldquo;Is This Any Good?&rdquo;. But this question goes deeper. Because it goes to how you define yourself.</p>
<p>Identities are useful. They give you a lot of shortcuts to think about things. And they give you emotional context.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s helpful for me to not think of these identities while working. Occasionally, I&rsquo;ll ask myself one of these questions, and it&rsquo;ll make me want to quit and do something else. E.g. I&rsquo;m no good at this. I wasn&rsquo;t meant to do this. I quit. Or I&rsquo;m bored with this. I&rsquo;m not meant to do this anymore. I quit.</p>
<p>These might be valid observations on a periodic basis. (And I&rsquo;m not against quitting things) But in the moment they are unhelpful and will only get in the way.</p>
<h2 id="noticing-helps">Noticing Helps</h2>
<p>When these questions come up again while working, now you have a name for them and will be more likely to notice. And that hopefully will help you produce more and get those reps in.</p>
