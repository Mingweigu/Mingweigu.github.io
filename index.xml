      <description>I’m a millennial. Most of my generation learned about 70s American culture from parents or older relatives.
Me, I’m a child of immigrants. And I grew up a quintessential geek. So naturally what I learned about the 70s came from the internet.
Case in point, I learned about the Rocky Horror Picture Show in an online RPG, Barren Realms.
What’s a MUD? Like most RPGs, Barren Realms asks you to create a fantasy-themed character.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Mingwei Gu, and this is my personal website and blog.
I spent eight years at YipitData, a data-driven investment research firm in NYC. When I left, I was leading a multi-disciplinary engineering team developing tools and platforms for internal data analyst teams.
Before that, I briefly worked in derivatives trading. And before that, I graduated from MIT with a degree in math with computer science.
Currently, I’m exploring product ideas in the data engineering and analytics space.</description>
