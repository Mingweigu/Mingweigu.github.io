      <description>Hi, I’m Mingwei Gu, and this is my personal website and blog.
I spent eight years at YipitData, a data-driven investment research firm in NYC. When I left, I was leading a multi-disciplinary engineering team developing tools and platforms for internal data analyst teams.
Before that, I briefly worked in derivatives trading. And before that, I graduated from MIT with a degree in math with computer science.
Currently, I’m exploring product ideas in the data engineering and analytics space.</description>
